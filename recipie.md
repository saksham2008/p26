Step 1
Take one teaspoon of green tea leaves. If you want to make more than a cup of green tea, take 1 teaspoon of green tea leaves for each cup. So, take 4 teaspoons of green tea leaves for 4 cups of green tea.

Step 2
Now, take the tea leaves in a strainer/sieve and keep aside.

Step 3
Now, take a stainless steel pot/pan and boil the water. If you want to use a glass teapot instead, go ahead. The ideal temperature for green tea is 80°C to 85°C, so keep an eye on the water to make sure it’s not boiling. If it starts boiling anyway, just switch off the gas/heat and let it cool for a bit (say, for 30-45 seconds).

Step 4
Now, place the sieve/ strainer over the cup or mug.

Step 5
Next, pour the hot water into the cup and let the tea steep for 3 minutes. This is the step where we need to be very careful. Not everyone likes their tea strong, so, to check whether the tea is just right, keep a spoon handy and drink a spoonful of tea every 30-45 seconds to find out if the flavor is right for you.

Step 6
Now, take out the sieve and keep it aside. If you want, you may add 1 teaspoon honey.

Step 7
Stir the honey in and let the drink cool for a few seconds. Enjoy your cup of green tea.
